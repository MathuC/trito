    overscroll-behavior: none; /*this is for when in phones you swipe from top to

	with it for some weird reason. When overscoll-behavior: contain, it works but there 
	is this shadow glow thing that appears on top, it doesn't do anything but still looks annoying.
	Found out about this on this official google dev page, which explains everything 
	about this new feature: https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/11/overscroll-behavior
	
	SUMMARY: overflow: auto, overscroll-behavior: none, 
	and document.getElementById("body").style.position="fixed"; in the html file make this
	website stationary on mobile sites and disable scrolling.

Because of this I don't need to put max-width=97% for the canvas to be centered, it is centered at 100% which makes my life easier for translating touch controls into the right coordinates src= src=  https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_box-sizing.asp    */
	max-width: 100%; 
	/*It is to make the game more visible in mobile games. width=100% alone also enlarges 
	the canvas, but max-width only makes the canvas smaller so it fits inside screens but never enlarges 
	it, so it still looks good in the desktop version. On mobile for some reason max-width: 100% makes the canvas go slightly to the left (BEFORE NOT NOW because of box-sizing) so I have to put 97%
