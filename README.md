#Trito

Trito is a simple javascript canvas game to play on computers. I thought of the idea and design for this simple game for starting to learn Javascript and I made it exculsively using documentation online (mostly pdf's).
banner.png, corona.wav, gameOver.wav and point.wav were entirely made by me.

Updates:
1. I started coding this project on the 16th of July 2020.I need to finish this on the 19th of July 2020 at 11:59PM (bet).

2. I finished the game on the 18th at night but want to add more features, like the leaderboard, so I will still be working on this after the 19th (won the bet).
