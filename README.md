#Trito

Trito is a simple javascript canvas game to play on computers. I thought of this game and decided to make it.

I started coding this project on the 16th of July 2020.I need to finish this on the 19th of July 2020 at 11:59PM. 

banner.png and gameOver.wav were entirely made by me.

I finished the game on the 18th at night but want to add more features, like the leaderboard, so I will be working on this after the 19th.
