#Trito

Trito is a simple javascript canvas game to play on computers. I thought of the idea and design for this simple game for starting to learn Javascript and I made it exculsively using documentation online (mostly pdf's).
banner.png, instructions.png corona.wav, gameOver.wav and point.wav were entirely made by me.

Updates:
1. I started coding this project on the 16th of July 2020.I need to finish this on the 19th of July 2020 at 11:59PM (bet).

2. I finished the game on the 18th at night but want to add more features, like the leaderboard, so I will still be working on this after the 19th (won the bet).

3.Completely changed the controls after a friend who tested my game told me about keyup event in JS, which made me go back to my original plan of using WASD as controls instead of 7 keys (A,S,D,J,K,L,Space) (since I first erroneously thought there was only a keydown event and that there was no way of knowing if a key was "being pressed")
	A and D are for the positions Left and Right
	S and W are for dividing the square into 2 parts or 3 parts.

4.Added two more combinations of keys (2 more: W-A and W-D)
