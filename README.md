# Trito

[Trito](https://mathusan.net/Trito/index.html) is a simple javascript canvas game where you dodge the squares coming your way. Even if it doesn't follow good software engineering principles, I've left it on here because it is the first full-stack website I've ever built and it is also a pretty fun and addicting game.

## Components
`canvas.js` has the whole game in a canvas that draws every 10 milliseconds (100 times per second) so that the animation is smooth.

`index.html` has the main structure of the page, the title of the page and few paragraphs below the canvas.

`style.css` has few informations about the background colour and the font of texts.

## Big Changes
1. Me and my friend (https://github.com/therealsangwoohan) decided we needed to learn JavaScript, so we told challenged ourselves to make a full stack website in 3 days or we would need to give the other person our FaceBook account for a whole day and they could do anything with it. I started coding this project on 16/07/2020. I had to complete the game by 19/07/2020.

2. I finished the game on the 18th at night but want to add more features, like the leaderboard, so I will still be working on this after the 19th. I completed the challenge and my friend also completed it, so no one went through the punishment.

3. Completely changed the controls after a friend who tested my game and gave me some feedback.
	1. A and D are for the positions Left and Right
	1. S and W are for dividing the square into 2 parts or 3 parts.

4. Added few more combinations of keys to make the game harder and more complex. 

5. Finished the server-side scripts (PHP) to interact with a database (MySQL). 

6. The Websites was put online with a url on 26/07/2020.
