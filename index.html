		<!-- The reason why I am putting this script here is because HTML loads from top to bottom. So I tried
		putting this script in the canvas.js file and what happened is that the title changed font since 
		that element (title) was created before I called the script, but for the other elements (subtitle, p1-p4)
		it didn't work since those elements didn't exist yet and it actually gave a NULL error
